INTRODUCTION                                    *autolink*

This plugin provides an interface to autolink.

Autolink is a program that can automatically fetch metadata of web pages.
This is useful when writing because one does not have to manually copy e.g.
the title of an article.  Some social networking sites provide a similar
feature.

This plugin uses the contents of the |quoteplus| register as the URL.

This plugin uses two variables, g:autolink_download_provider and
g:autolink_executable.  The former must be an executable that accepts a URL at
the end and sends the web page contents to standard output.  By default the
plugin uses wget with the value
>
    let g:autolink_download_provider = 'wget --quiet -O -'
<

Another choice would be to use cURL with e.g.
>
    let g:autolink_download_provider = 'curl --silent --compressed'
<

The latter configuration variable, g:autolink_executable, is the location of
the autolink program.  By default the plugin uses the value
>
    let g:autolink_executable = 'autolink'
